# Lead Management Frontend

A simple **Lead Capture and Management Module** built with **React + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap**.

---

##  Why Bootstrap instead of Tailwind?

Initially, the project was started with **Tailwind CSS**, but due to unexpected PostCSS and Tailwind plugin configuration errors during Vite setup, the build process was failing.  

To save time and keep the project running smoothly, we migrated to **Bootstrap 5**.  
This required only **minor changes in class names**, while the component and project structure remained the same.  

ðŸ‘‰ Result: Faster setup, cleaner UI, and no PostCSS issues

##  Features
- Lead Capture Form with validation (Name, Email, Phone, Interest)
- Lead List with structured display
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap
- Modular component-based structure
